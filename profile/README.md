# Welcome to the Official GooblerStudios GitHub! 👋

❗ You can find the source code for all the Goobler apps!

🔍 We pride ourselves in our transparency and privacy, so we made all our apps Open Source!

🍿 Fun fact - We only have 8 staff members running the entirety of Goobler, but that doesn't mean the company is bad!

We hope you find what you're looking for in the GitHub!
